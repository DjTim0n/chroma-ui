# Chroma UI

This is not an official project. Initially, I developed this for myself because it was getting difficult for me check the collections and records through code and APIs can be overwhelming as I am used to access the database using GUI tools like DBeaver, MongoDB Compass etc. So here, I have open sourced it in case someone also feeling the same. It is also hosted at https://chroma-ui.vercel.app and source code is hosted at https://github.com/thakkaryash94/chroma-ui.
